# How to get started for development

After cloning, all gems needed should already be in the gem file. You need to run bundle install to install all dependencies, then rails db:create to start a new database.

# How to run tests

To run rspec tests run **rspec** in the terminal, to run cucumber tests run **rails cucumber** in the terminal.

# How to deploy

To run/deploy locally, run **rails s** to start
To run your own version on heroku (for whatever reason), you'll need to clone the repo, and run **heroku create -a <name>** and do the getting started steps using the **heroku run** prefix
